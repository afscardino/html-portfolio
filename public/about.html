      <p class="blurb"style="color:#605678">If you are interested in the professional side of me, you can very much find that my other pages. Otherwise, you're in the right spot! <br> 
        <br>What is there to know about me? I've tried to write this page numerous times and almost left it to Lorem Ipsum. Without hiring someone 
        to do it for me or chance it to AI, I think I can summate it to: I care. For better or worse, I truly give a shit. Oh, and I curse a lot. Like, US Navy Officers have told me so. I can't help it.<br>
        <br>Care about what? About it all. I care deeply for my family and friends and want them to be happy and successful. I care so very much about the art I continue to create. 
        None of it is sold and it's often given to friends. I care deeply about the work that I do; often it's for 'worse' in the 'for better or worse' platitude. 
        I believe being a 'creative' in a technological field that is evolving into computer science more and more each day would be 10 times more difficult if I didn't care as I do. <br>
        <br>This is starting to get a bit pretentious sounding. Of course, I have hobbies. Making art by any means possible is my favorite, but playing ice hockey, traveling, and spending time with my family and friends are 
        close behind. I often have thoughts and I sometimes jot them down. I'll probably have a blog on here soon enough; I'm sure that will say more about who I am than this page could.

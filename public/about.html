    <p>i was super tempted to just leave the Lorem ipsum in here, but i guess i'll mention some things. firstly, 
      as i mentioned, this site has been created entirely because i'm striving to get better at web development.
      as i progress in the course, so will this site.... hopefully - that's the idea anyway.</p>
    <p>i'm currently a geospatial soultions architect who has the privilege of working from home. i've been
      solving geospatial problems for about 2 decades now. i do this by making far fewer maps than i used to or
      would like to. hence, my progression into development.</p>
    <p>personally, i'm married to the best person on earth and have been lucky enough to become stepdad to 
      the best cutest black cat. the rest of my family is great too, my brother and sister are far smarter than me.
      my hobbies include drawing and playing hockey. i did a neat little python project with my fitness statistics,
      you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/afscardino/hockeyMetrics">here.</a></p>

        <h3>I'm not a developer... yet!</h3>
        <p>
            This page will serve to house much of the lesson output I complete working my way through 
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp.'</a>
            I'm sure it will evolve as the course does. I haven't done actual site building since back when 
            <a href="https://archive.org/web/geocities.php" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">GeoCities</a> was a thing. So far, it's a pretty great course; 
            I'm quite enjoying it.

            <a href="./mondrian.html">One of a few</a> CSS Projects. This was using Grid, recreating a <a href="https://www.wikiart.org/en/piet-mondrian" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Piet Mondrian</a> painting. It really tested me.

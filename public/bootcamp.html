            this page will serve to house all of the lesson output as i work through 
            <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp.'</a>
            i'm sure it will evolve as the course does. i haven't done html since back when geocities was a thing.
            so far, it's a pretty great course; i'm quite enjoying it.

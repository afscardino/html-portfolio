        Firstly, this site has been created entirely because I'm striving to improve/build my web development skillset.
      As I progress in the <a href="https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/">'The Complete Web Development Bootcamp'</a> 
      so will this site.... hopefully - that's the idea anyway.</p>
    <p>
        By day I'm a Solutions Architect, by night... well, I'm also a Solutions Architect, I'm just not working 
      then. I have the privilege of working from <a href="https://www.visitphilly.com/"> home</a>, where I've been 
      solving geospatial problems for about 2 decades now. I do this by making far fewer maps than I used to or
      would like to. Hence, my progression into development. I started my journey into geospatial through a bit luck 
      when I moved from graphic design to geography, inspired by my father's work at PennDOT.</p>
    <p>Personally, I'm married to the best person on earth and have been lucky enough to become stepdad to 
      the cutest black cat. The rest of my family is great too; my brother and sister are far smarter than me.
      My hobbies have always included making art by any means possible and being mediocre at hockey. I did a neat 
      little python project with my fitness statistics, you can check it out <a href="https://github.com/afscardino/hockeyMetrics">here.</a></p>
